\newlineparagraph{Among Us} 

Among Us is a great example of how much a game can be captivating almost solely relying on players' interactions: we want our game to take advantage of the social element and be player-driven, so that each match feels unique and engaging.

\noindent For this reason, we will endorse through game mechanics (Speak action) the possibility to communicate and to cooperate to some extent, letting player elaborate several strategies and mindgames.

\newlineparagraph{Zero Escape: The Nonary Games} 

Similarly to Zero Escape, we want to create a somewhat eerie survival atmosphere: the unvoluntary attendants of this game need to choose between allying with others or betray them in order to reach the Room 9, an escape from the cruel trial they're subjected to.

\noindent In our game we extend this concept to a multiplayer mode, introducing the human factor: each player will feel trapped, urging to find the Broom (thus an exit from this grim dungeon) through all means necessary, allying with others and betraying them when the occasion requires so.

\newlineparagraph{Room25}

Each room in our game, like in Room25, has its own identity and purpose: it's up to the players to skulk around carefully, avoiding traps and hazards to reach the exit. Furthermore, the turn-based system and actions are similar.

\noindent We built up over this base, making the rooms more active and dynamic; upon arriving into a room, a short puzzle must be cleared in order to get a boon or avoid a threat from them. Through them, we gave even more tools to survive and to sabotage the progress of others during the research of the Broom, or stop them in their tracks completely.

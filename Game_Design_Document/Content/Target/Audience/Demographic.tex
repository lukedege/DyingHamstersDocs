\subsubsection{Demographic classification}
Based on the gameplay mechanics and genre, we expect the game will appeal to the tastes of 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Teens 13-18}: since in this age taste toward games are everchanging and often follow the trend of the moment, a simple but challenging competitive game can attract the interest of teenagers looking for some time well spent with (and against) their friends.
	\item \textbf{Young adults 18-24}: even if in this age interests are well defined, our game offers a mix of strategy and puzzle, making it able to enthrall multiple tastes, also thanks to the added social factor. 
\end{itemize}

Moreover, the targeted age groups appears to be more prone to Competition and Destruction between the most common primary gaming motivations

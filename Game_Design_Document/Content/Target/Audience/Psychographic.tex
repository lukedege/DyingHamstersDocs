\largeparagraph{Killer: 100\%}
Killers are the main focus of our game since its goal is to dominate others and get the Broom before them. To ensure so, we offer the players plenty of tools to fight, deceive and hinder others in form of rooms, items and even through basic actions. The game is designed to pit every player against the other from the very start and only through conflict one will be able to emerge victorious: for this reason we expect fierce competition, similarly to other battle royale games.

\largeparagraph{Achiever: 60\%}
Achievers will enjoy their stay in the game thanks to many ways they can boast their status inside and outside every match: earnable character customizations, badges, achievements, stats and leaderboards will make them feel important among the others.

\largeparagraph{Socializer: 40\%}
Socializers could take pleasure from the interaction with other players, cooperating and communicating to get as close as possible to the goal before eventually breaking up bonds. Socializers will feel better in other gamemodes (such as team-based ones).

\largeparagraph{Explorer: 20\%}
This game is not bread and butter for Explorers since the only thing that changes from match to match is the layout of the rooms and the players and, in the long run, will lack novelty from the exploring point of view. There could be some easter egg or hidden reference to other popular games they could enjoy but this doesn't make up for the whole game experience.

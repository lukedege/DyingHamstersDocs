\subsubsection{Geographic classification}
The game will ship worldwide and we shouldn't expect many issues. \\

An in-game filtering system will be provided to censor crude graphics (blood, skulls) and cursing in the chat. \\

Overall the game hardly relies on many lines of text, focusing more on clear and widespread symbols and icons to represent concepts and visual and sound effects to display what is happening on the screen.

\subsection{Platform}
Our game will be developed for PC, Web (HTML5) and Android: we chose these platforms for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item they suit best our tabletop-like gameplay through touch or mouse interactions.
	\item developing for consoles is extremely expensive, and the tabletop genre isn't popular enough on consoles.
	\item puzzle/strategy games are extremely popular on PC and mobile platforms.
\end{itemize}

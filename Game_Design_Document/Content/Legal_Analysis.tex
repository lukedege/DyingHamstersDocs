\section{Legal Analysis}

\textit{The Secret of Alexandria 51: The Room of Alexandriaâ€™s Broom} is a new IP and, as such, has not been copyrighted already, thus it is free to use. \\
All the digital content - 2D sprites, soundtrack, and so on - will be designed and created by the development team or commissioned to external artists. \\

The expected PEGI rating for this game is PEGI 16 since we have depictions of violence that reaches a stage in which looks the same as would be expected in real life violence, usage of drugs to some extent and a possibly a certain level of cursing involved. \\

\section{Legal Analysis}

[TODO GameTitle] is a new IP and, as such, has not been copyrighted already, thus it is free to use. \\
All the digital content - 2D sprites, soundtrack, and so on - will be designed and created by the development team or commissioned to external artists. \\
The expected PEGI rating for this game is \textbf{TODO PEGI 16-18} since we have depictions of violence that reaches a stage in which looks the same as would be expected in real life violence, usage of drugs to some extent and a possibly a certain level of cursing involved. \\

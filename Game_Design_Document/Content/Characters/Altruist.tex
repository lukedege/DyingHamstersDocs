\sidewrapgraphics{../Pictures/Concept/Characters/Altruist_front.png}{15}

The category of altruists is the least widespread among the descendants of Alexandria 51. In a government based on prevailing over others, altruists are the classic good-hearted heroes who help others only to see them happy ... or at least, that is what they want you to believe! They are very devious people,
trying to take advantage of their fake grace. Helping the enemy is part of their strategy. You can be sure they will betray your trust when you least expect it!\\
The altruist shows up as an esteemed and respectable person, of the upper middle class. A tender face that hides a cruel personality.\\\\
Their in-game special ability is  \textit{"Spontaneous Help"}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Once per game you can \textbf{Heal} a damaged enemy as an extra free-cost action. The enemy, however, is \textbf{Trapped} for the next turn.
\end{itemize}

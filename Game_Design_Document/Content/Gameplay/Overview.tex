You are a scavenger who wanders into the secret laboratory of Alexandria 51, a ghost town that was once thriving and technologically advanced city. Some rumours tell of an ancient artifact that gave Alexandria all its power, so you are in search of that magical artifact. Your fellow criminals, who helped you reach the complex, are now your enemies, who will try everything to get to the artifact before you and find the way out, leaving you locked up in that disturbing place!\\
Only one of you will succeed in the enterprise. To beat your enemies you will have to be faster and smarter than them, using the effects of the rooms you discover in your favor!\\

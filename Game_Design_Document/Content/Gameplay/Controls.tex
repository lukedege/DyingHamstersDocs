\subsection{Controls}
Controls of our game are point and click, so the user will need a mouse (or a touchpad screen) in order to play the game, just by pressing buttons or dragging the left mouse key when solving puzzles.\\
Some minigames involve the use of directional keys. On devices without a keyboard, an on-screen virtual D-pad will be available.

\subsubsection{Rules}
The game proceeds cycling in phases. We have 3 phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choosing Phase: all the players choose their next turn actions based on their status that affects the quantity/type of actions that he can perform.
\item Executing Phase: all the actions are evaluated following a given players order. This order change turn by turn in rotation order, changing which player is evaluated first.
\item Puzzle Phase: all the players that enter for the first time in an undiscovered room 
\end{itemize}
If a player dies all his equipment ( including, eventually, the Broom ) is dropped in the floor of his current room. The first player to enter the room automatically takes all the equipment. \\
If the player was killed by another player, all his equipment is transferred to the killer. \\

\subsection{Estimated Delivery Time}
We estimate that the game is going to be developed in 8 months, starting from the end of June 2021 up until the beta release on the 1st of March 2022.

\subsection{Delivery Platform}
The PC      version of the game will be delivered through Steam. 
The Android version of the game will be delivered through the Google App Store.
The HTML    version of the game will be available in a dedicated page within our website.

\subsection{Delivery Methodology}
Steam is used to sell the game for a starting price of 4,99€, advertisement-free.
The Android version is available for free through the Google App Store with advertisements, but an in-app purchase of the same price to prevent the advertisements.
We take advantage of those platforms to manage users login and to associate achievements to an user. A game account from one platform can be linked to the user in the other platform. When this happens, the obtained achievements are shown on both platforms.

We also take advantage of the platforms in-app purchase API to manage the purchase of cosmetics. Buying cosmetics in one platform will make them available in both PC and Android clients for the same account.

The HTML version in our website will be playable for free by logging in using a Google Account in order to keep track of player's progress and achievements.

In the HTML client there will be advertisements.

All the 3 clients can host private matches and share an "invitation" keyword to invite friends to play. Crossplay is available across all clients.

The clients with advertisements behave as follows:
A fullscreen advertisement before each match, plus an advertisement will play every time the player is in a room without a puzzle while the other players are completing their own puzzles.

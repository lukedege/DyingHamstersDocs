\subsection{Network Requirements}

\subsubsection{Outside}
Our bandwith requirements are minimal, since we only have to exchange small TCP packets for every game turn between players and server, and only a couple of minigames require real-time communication between an individual client and the server for cheating-prevention.
Similarly there are not strict requirements for latency, an high latency can be tolerated. Moreover any exceptional latency can be masked pretending other players still have to make their actions choice for the ongoing turn. For real time minigames, the only purpose of the network usage is checking for cheating, which even on high latency can be achieved through time deltas and positions interpolation. Since there's no real-time multiplayer noone will notice it.

A latency of 200ms on average should be fine, with 1s+ starting to get noticeable in case the timer for chosing actions has already expired before receiving the information about the next turn. But again, it doesn't affect gameplay.

Bandwith: 1Kbit/s should be more than enough fur a full lobby. In the worst case we have to share the action choices for each characters, the coordinates of the rooms targeted by an action, the index of the player targeted by an action, and eventual room effects. Sending 100 to each player integers is more than enough, with a lot of headroom. Cheat-prevention for the most real-time minigame (Bullet hell) can be achievend sending a coordinates pair from the client to the server around two times per second.


\subsubsection{Inside}
The inside network doesn’t require particular attention because the AWS infrastructure is efficient and powerful enough.

\subsection{Network Hardware}
Relying on the services offered by renting machines using AWS, it isn’t necessary to manage the hardware physically. Amazon Web Services guarantee remote access to those machines using AWS Elastic Beanstalk software.

\subsection{Network Software}
No additional specialized software is required for our network.

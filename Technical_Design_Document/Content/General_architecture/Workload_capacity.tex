\subsection{Workload Capacity}
According to the estimations done in the \textbf{Workload Estimation} section, our Frontend and Backend infrastructure should not suffer from Workload Capacity issues.\\
For our servers we specifically choose T2 instaces for Web application, whose key feature is the possibility to scale up the computational power according to our needs, and C4 instances for Game Servers with auto-scaling system to deactivate unused servers or activate new ones when needed, while avoiding useless resource usage.\\
Moreover, our DynamoDB database is adapting capacity and performaces using on-demand capacity mode, to overcome every possible scenarios.\\

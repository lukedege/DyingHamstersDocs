\subsubsection*{Purpose}
A Technical Design Document describes a solution to a given technical problem. It is a specification, or “design blueprint”, for a software program or feature. The primary function of a TDD is to communicate the technical details of the work to be done to members of the team. However, there is a second purpose which is just as important: the process of writing the TDD forces you to organize your thoughts and consider every aspect of the design, ensuring that you haven’t left anything out.
